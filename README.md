# Landing for events 

Here I'll show you a quick guide of how to run this app locally:

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Download the repository** 📥

    You can download the repository as zip file or clone it to you computer, with the green button "Code" 🟩 in the top navigation of Github.

2.  **Install dependencies** 🧰

    Once you have it locally, open the terminal, go to the project folder:

    ```shell
    cd path-of-file/folder
    ```
    
    Then run: 
    
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run localhost** 💻

    Now run this command to build your app, and have it at you localhost: 
    
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

    Your site is now probably running at http://localhost:8000!

4.  **Deploy** 🌐

    You can find the Netlify deploy [here](https://keen-lichterman-2a58fe.netlify.app/)
